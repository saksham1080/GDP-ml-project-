# GDP Prediction ML Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of a country based on various economic indicators. The goal is to analyze and forecast GDP trends to support data-driven decision-making.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, normalization, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analysis of GDP trends and relationships with indicators.
- **Model Development**: Implementation of machine learning algorithms for GDP prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing model accuracy with metrics like R-squared, MAE, and RMSE.
- **Visualization**: Interactive plots for better insights into predictions and actual data.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saksham1080/GDP-ml-project-.git
